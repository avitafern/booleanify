# Booleanify
Easily type boolean algebra.

## Some examples
a and b → a ∧ b <br />
a or b and c → a ∨ b ∧ c <br />
not a or b → ¬ a ∨ b <br />
( not a or b ) and c → ( ¬ a ∨ b ) ∧ c (Space is required after bracket open and close) <br />

## Rationale of development
Last semester I was frustrated at typing boolean expressions for an assignment. It was infuriating to type it in word. I had to go with non-conventional symbols such as ' instead of ¬ which looked poor. Hence, I decided to make this to help students and any individual to easily convert English to Boolean expression.
